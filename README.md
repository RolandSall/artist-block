# Artist Block


This application is part of the final project of the Software Engineering class at the Lebanese American University. The application aims to apply software engineering practices by implementing a software solution for a specific topic. <br>
In this project, we created **Artist Block**, an AI-powered platform that connects people interested in buying artistic works with aspiring artists around the world. Clients can use the tools offered by the platform to produce AI-generated painting designs, which they will then share with painters interested to collaborate with them. Clients can check out the paintersâ€™ profiles and previous works before engaging in any agreement. Moreover, painters can also use the platform to sell their original works. 


# Application Architecture

The software solution follow a microservice approach using common patterns such as gateway, discovery and configuration service. The application also consist of two standalone react application that each serve a puprpose


# Running The React Application

To run the front-end application, simply navigate to the desired directory. There you will a find another README.md file that will help you install the dependencies

# Running The Backend Services

## Spring Boot Services
Each of the backend services is equiped with a docker file. To run the services run the following commands

```
docker build -t <image-name> .
docker run <image-name>
```
Or you could simply run a spring boot application from command file by exectuing the jar file or with the help of an [IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/spring-boot.html)

## .NET service

First you to have [.NET CORE 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) installed. After running installing the SDK, you could Rider to run the application easily by selecting of
the two environements
```
Staging envrionment --> Linked To Staging DB (if you have access to the credentials)
Local envrionment --> Linked To dev DB
```
You could also run the application using docker.

## GAN service

The gan service runs on [Google Colab](https://github.com/anisdismail/AI-Art-Generator-API). No need to install any dependencies just run the block and you will have a result similar to
```
ngrok: ....
```
The latter means that your FastAPI application is exposed on this specific IP and Port.

## Samples 
This service allows the other services to interact with the GAN model and provide it with text and the desired image size to generate paintings.

**Demo can be provided upon Request**

_NOTE: Some of the logic (UI,AI,BE services) might be hidden to current viewers. for full access contact any of the project admins_
